# NammaSakhi – Everyday Assistant in Every Indian Language

## 👩‍💻 Team: HustleHERS

### 🚀 Project Overview

**NammaSakhi** is a WhatsApp-based multilingual chatbot designed to empower women with limited digital literacy by providing real-time assistance for digital tasks, government schemes, emergency help, and digital safety education. The platform fosters autonomy and digital independence using technologies women already trust and use daily.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Despite India’s digital boom, many women—especially in rural areas—remain excluded from digital services due to:
- Low digital literacy
- Language barriers
- Lack of awareness and mistrust of unfamiliar apps

This leads to dependency on male family members for routine digital tasks like:
- Accessing welfare schemes
- Making digital payments
- Seeking emergency help

The absence of a trusted, culturally familiar digital assistant worsens this divide, leaving women vulnerable and disempowered.
